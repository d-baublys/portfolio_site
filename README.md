# Portfolio Site

A single-page site for presenting my web development portfolio projects, with a focus on a memorable and interactive front-end.
It is an evolution of the original version (https://github.com/d-baublys/portfolio-site-original-layout), now using a carousel layout adapted from my Next.js e-commerce site project (https://github.com/d-baublys/ecommerce-site) for scalability.
